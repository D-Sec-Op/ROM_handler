This program is designed to automate the process of unzipping and sorting ROMs by console, both on local machine and external storage used for transferring games to a Retro Pie. SCP Functionality is in the works.

Code was written when I first learned Python, as such it is terrible and will benefit from optimization. Currently only works when following a very specific directory structure for folders.

When I get some free time the program will be fully rewritten, and proper documentation provided. Currenntly being a student though hobby project is on the backburner.
